# SLR PDF Generation - Fixed!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The "FPDF error: The document is closed" issue has been resolved.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### SLRDocumentService.php
- ✅ Removed unused `$pdfGenerator` property from class
- ✅ Removed `new PDFGenerator()` instantiation from constructor
- ✅ Fixed indentation in `createSLRPDF()` method
- ✅ All PDF generation code now properly wrapped in try-catch

## 🎯 What Now Works

1. ✅ Single SLR document generation (by loan ID)
2. ✅ Bulk SLR document generation (multiple loans)
3. ✅ Client SLR document generation (all loans for a client)

## 📝 How to Use

### Generate Single SLR
Navigate to: `/public/documents/slr.php?action=generate`
- Select a loan from the dropdown
- Click "Generate SLR"
- PDF downloads automatically

### Generate Bulk SLRs
Navigate to: `/public/documents/slr.php?action=bulk`
- Select multiple loans
- Click "Generate Bulk SLRs"
- ZIP file with all PDFs downloads

### Generate Client SLRs
Navigate to: `/public/documents/slr.php?action=client`
- Select a client
- Click "Generate Client SLRs"
- Single PDF or ZIP file downloads (depending on number of loans)

## 🐛 What Caused the Bug

The bug was caused by:
1. An unused PDFGenerator instance in the service constructor
2. Improper indentation causing code to be outside try-catch block
3. Potential state conflicts when generating multiple PDFs

## ✨ How the Fix Works

Each PDF generation now:
1. Creates a fresh, independent PDFGenerator instance
2. Generates the PDF completely
3. Returns the PDF as a string
4. Properly handles any errors

No more shared state = No more "document is closed" errors!
