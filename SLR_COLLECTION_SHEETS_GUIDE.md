## üìã **SLR (Summary of Loan Release) Documents**

3. **Audit Requirements**: For compliance and record-keeping purposes
4. **Transfer/Review**: When client accounts are reviewed or transferred

### **SLR Content Includes:**

## üìù **Collection Sheets System**

### **What are Collection Sheets?**
**Collection Sheets** are daily reports that Account Officers use to track and submit client payments they've collected in the field.

### **Purpose & Business Function:**
- **Field Collection Tracking**: Account Officers record payments collected from clients
- **Accountability**: Creates audit trail for who collected what from whom
- **Payment Processing**: Enables bulk posting of payments by Cashiers
- **Cash Blotter Integration**: Records collections as "inflow" in daily cash tracking

### **Collection Sheet Workflow:**

#### **1. Account Officer Creates Collection Sheet:**
```
Location: /public/collection-sheets/add.php
Process:
1. Account Officer logs in
2. Creates new collection sheet for today
3. Selects client from dropdown
4. System shows client's active loans via AJAX
5. Enters payment amount (auto-filled with weekly amount)
6. Adds multiple collection items throughout the day
7. Submits sheet for Cashier approval
```

#### **2. Cashier Reviews & Approves:**
```
Location: /public/collection-sheets/approve.php
Process:
1. Cashier reviews submitted collection sheets
2. Verifies amounts and client information
3. Can approve, reject (with reason), or request changes
4. Approved sheets move to "ready for posting" status
```

#### **3. Cashier Posts Payments:**
```
Process:

2. Clicks "Post All Payments" 
3. System automatically:
   - Creates payment records in database

   - Creates cash blotter entries (inflow)
   - Logs all transactions for audit
   - Changes collection sheet status to "posted"
```

### **Collection Sheet Statuses:**
- **Draft**: Account Officer is still adding items

- **Approved**: Cashier approved, ready for payment posting
- **Posted**: Payments have been recorded in system
- **Rejected**: Cashier rejected with reason (back to Account Officer)
