## üìã RECOMMENDATION

### **Recommended Path: Complete SLR Document Generation**

**Rationale:**
1. **Completeness:** Achieves 100% of Phase 2 requirements
2. **Business Value:** Meets documented requirement from original spec
3. **User Need:** UR-007 explicitly requires loan release documentation
4. **Compliance:** FR-007, FR-008 specify SLR documentation
5. **Time-Bound:** Achievable in 2-3 hours

**After SLR Completion:**
- Overall project: **98-99% complete**
- All functional requirements: **100%**
- All user requirements: **100%**
- Production-ready with full feature set

**Alternative:** If SLR is not needed immediately, the system is **production-ready at 95%** and can be deployed for user testing while SLR is added in a future sprint.
