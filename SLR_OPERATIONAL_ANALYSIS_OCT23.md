# SLR System Operational Analysis & Fixes - October 23, 2025

## üîç Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Method Visibility Issue**
**Problem**: `logSLRAccess()` method was private in SLRService but called publicly in generate.php
**Fix**: Changed method visibility from `private` to `public`
**Impact**: Allows proper access logging when viewing SLR documents

### 2. **Incorrect Include Path**
**Problem**: generate.php included `../../public/init.php` (wrong path)
**Fix**: Changed to `../init.php` (correct relative path)
**Impact**: Proper initialization and autoloading of required classes

### 3. **PDF Output Method Issue**
**Problem**: PDFGenerator's output() method defaulted to browser output ('I')
**Fix**: Changed default parameter to string output ('S')
**Impact**: SLR documents can now be properly saved to files

### 4. **Storage Directory Permissions**
**Problem**: Potential directory access issues
**Fix**: Verified all storage directories exist with proper permissions
**Impact**: Ensures SLR documents can be saved and managed

## ‚úÖ Verification Results

### Database Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ All 3 SLR tables exist and functional
- ‚úÖ 3 default generation rules properly configured
