# Enhanced Overdue Payments Module - Design & Functionality Upgrade

## Overview
The overdue payments module has been completely redesigned and enhanced with advanced analytics, consistent styling patterns from other modules, and improved database querying for accurate overdue tracking.

## âœ… Enhanced Database Querying & Analytics

### New OverduePaymentService
- **File**: `/app/services/OverduePaymentService.php`
- **Purpose**: Provides accurate overdue payment tracking based on actual payment schedules
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time calculation of expected vs. actual payments
  - Severity classification based on multiple factors
  - Payment schedule analysis
  - Collection rate calculations

### Advanced Overdue Logic
Instead of simple completion date comparison, the system now:
1. **Analyzes Payment Schedules**: Calculates expected payments based on disbursement date and term
2. **Grace Period Handling**: 7-day grace period before marking as overdue
3. **Multi-Factor Severity**: Based on days overdue, payment shortfall, and loan amount
4. **Collection Rate Tracking**: Measures actual vs expected payment performance

### Severity Classification System
- **ðŸ”´ Critical**: 60+ days overdue OR 50%+ of loan amount in arrears
- **ðŸŸ  High**: 30+ days overdue OR 4+ payments behind OR 25%+ in arrears  
- **ðŸ”µ Medium**: 14+ days overdue OR 2+ payments behind
- **âšª Low**: Recently overdue (monitor status)

## âœ… Consistent Design Implementation

            <div class="page-icon rounded d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
                <i data-feather="alert-triangle"></i>
            </div>
            <h1 class="notion-page-title mb-0">Overdue Payments Management</h1>
