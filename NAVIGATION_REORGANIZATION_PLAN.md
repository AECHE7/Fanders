# Navigation Analysis & Reorganization Plan

## Current Navbar/Sidebar Structure Analysis

### Current Menu Items (in order):
1. **Dashboard** - Main overview page
2. **Loans** - Loan management 
3. **Clients** - Client management
4. **Payments** - Payment records
5. **Collection Sheets** - Collection management
6. **Cash Blotter** - Cash tracking
7. **SLR Documents** - Statement of Loan Receipt documents
8. **Reports** - Various reports
9. **Transactions** - Transaction audit log
10. **Staff Management** - User management
11. **Loan Approvals** - Special menu item with badge counter

### Current Quick Actions:
- New Loan
- Collection Sheet / Record Payments (conditional)
- SLR Documents
- My Loans (for non-staff)

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Logical Grouping Issues**
- **Fragmented loan workflow**: Loans, Loan Approvals, and SLR Documents are separated
- **Mixed operational levels**: Core operations mixed with administrative functions
- **Unclear document management**: SLR Documents feels disconnected from workflow

### 2. **Role-Based Visibility Problems**
- Some menu items appear for roles that shouldn't have access
- Quick Actions don't align well with role capabilities
- Missing clear separation between operational and administrative functions

### 3. **User Experience Issues**
- No visual grouping or categories
- Important workflow items (like Loan Approvals) are buried
- No clear hierarchy for daily operations vs. administrative tasks
