        $dueDate = date('M d', strtotime($disbursementDate . ' +' . ($payment['week'] - 1) . ' weeks'));
        $runningBalance -= $payment['expected_payment'];
        
        // Add table row with alternating colors
        $fillColor = ($payment['week'] % 2 == 0) ? [248, 249, 250] : [255, 255, 255];
        $pdf->setFillColor($fillColor[0], $fillColor[1], $fillColor[2]);
        
        $pdf->addCell(15, 6, $payment['week'], 1, 0, 'C', true);
        $pdf->addCell(25, 6, $dueDate, 1, 0, 'C', true);
