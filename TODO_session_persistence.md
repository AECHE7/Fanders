# Session Persistence Implementation

## Information Gathered
- Current system uses session cookies that expire when browser closes
- Session timeout is set to 30 minutes of inactivity
- Session class manages session lifecycle
- AuthService handles login/logout operations

## Plan
### 1. Update Session Class (`app/core/Session.php`) ✅
- Change session cookie lifetime from 0 (session cookie) to 2592000 seconds (30 days)
- This makes sessions persistent across browser restarts

### 2. Enhance Logout Functionality (`app/services/AuthService.php`) ✅
- Ensure logout properly clears session data and deletes cookies
- Force cookie deletion to prevent session persistence after logout

### 3. Verify Session Timeout Logic ✅
- Confirm that inactivity timeout (30 minutes) still works correctly
- Sessions should only end on explicit logout or after timeout period

## Dependent Files to be edited
- `app/core/Session.php` - Changed cookie lifetime for persistence ✅
- `app/services/AuthService.php` - Enhanced logout to properly clear cookies ✅

## Followup steps
- Test login persistence across browser restarts
- Verify logout properly ends session
- Confirm inactivity timeout still works (30 minutes)
- Test session security (CSRF protection, etc.)
