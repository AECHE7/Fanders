## ðŸ”´ THE PROBLEM

When trying to add a new loan for a client **WITHOUT an active loan**, the submission fails.

```
âœ“ Calculate button works â†’ shows preview
âœ— Submit button fails â†’ stays on same page or shows generic error
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ MOST LIKELY CAUSES (in order)

### #1: Database Status Values Wrong Case (60% chance)
**Check:** 
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT status FROM loans LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected:** `Application`, `Approved`, `Active`, `Completed`, `Defaulted`  
**If you see:** `active`, `ACTIVE`, `application`, etc. â†’ **THIS IS THE ISSUE**

**Fix:** See page 3 (Database Fixes)

---

### #2: Error Message Hidden (50% chance)
**Symptom:** Form fails with "Failed to submit..." (too generic)  
**Reality:** Real error exists but not shown  

**Fix:** See page 3 (Code Fixes #2)

---

### #3: Status Comparison Case-Sensitive (40% chance)
**File:** `LoanModel.php` lines 282, 290  
**Fix:** See page 3 (Code Fixes #3)

---

## âš¡ QUICK FIXES (Do in This Order)

### FIX #1: Check Database (2 minutes)
```bash
# SSH to your server
mysql -u [user] -p[password] [database]

# Run this query
SELECT DISTINCT status FROM loans LIMIT 10;

# If status values are lowercase or mixed case:
# CONTINUE TO FIX #2
```

---

### FIX #2: Standardize Database Status (5 minutes)
```sql
-- Copy-paste this entire block:
UPDATE loans SET status = 'Application' WHERE LOWER(status) = 'application';
UPDATE loans SET status = 'Approved' WHERE LOWER(status) = 'approved';
UPDATE loans SET status = 'Active' WHERE LOWER(status) = 'active';
UPDATE loans SET status = 'Completed' WHERE LOWER(status) = 'completed';
UPDATE loans SET status = 'Defaulted' WHERE LOWER(status) = 'defaulted';

-- Verify
SELECT DISTINCT status FROM loans;
-- Should show exactly: Application, Approved, Active, Completed, Defaulted
```

---

### FIX #3: Update LoanModel.php (10 minutes)
**File:** `/workspaces/Fanders/app/models/LoanModel.php`

**Find Line 282:**
```php
// FIND THIS:
public function getClientActiveLoan($clientId) {
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM {$this->table}
            WHERE client_id = ? AND status = ?
            ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1";

// CHANGE TO:
public function getClientActiveLoan($clientId) {
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM {$this->table}
            WHERE client_id = ? AND LOWER(status) = LOWER(?)
            ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1";
```

**Find Line 290:**
```php
// FIND THIS:
public function hasClientDefaultedLoan($clientId) {
    $sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM {$this->table}
            WHERE client_id = ? AND status = ?";

// CHANGE TO:
public function hasClientDefaultedLoan($clientId) {
    $sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM {$this->table}
            WHERE client_id = ? AND LOWER(status) = LOWER(?)";
```

---

### FIX #4: Update add.php (10 minutes)
**File:** `/workspaces/Fanders/public/loans/add.php`

**Find Line 100-115:**
```php
// FIND THIS:
} else {
    $submissionError = $loanService->getErrorMessage();
    $error = $submissionError ?: "Failed to submit loan application.";
    $session->setFlash('error', $error);
}

// CHANGE TO:
} else {
    $submissionError = $loanService->getErrorMessage();
    
    if (!$submissionError || trim($submissionError) === '') {
        $error = "Failed to submit loan application. Please check the form and try again.";
        error_log("CRITICAL: Loan submission failed for client_id=" . $loan['client_id'] . " but no error message provided");
    } else {
        $error = $submissionError;
    }
    
    $session->setFlash('error', $error);
}
```

## ðŸ“ž IF STILL FAILING

### Check #1: Is form reaching the server?
```
Open: Browser DevTools (F12) â†’ Network tab
Action: Submit loan form
Look for: POST request to add.php
Check: Response code (should be 200, not 500)
```

### Check #2: Is error in PHP error log?
```bash
# Check PHP error log
tail -50 /var/log/php.log
# or wherever your PHP logs are

# Look for: "Loan submission failed"
# or: MySQL error messages
```

### Check #3: Is database query returning results?
```sql
-- Test the active loan query directly
SELECT * FROM loans WHERE client_id = 1 AND LOWER(status) = LOWER('Active');
-- Should return 0 rows for a client without active loans
```

### Check #4: Is error message empty?
```php
// Add this to add.php line 101 temporarily:
error_log("DEBUG: submissionError = '" . $loanService->getErrorMessage() . "'");
error_log("DEBUG: error = '" . $error . "'");

// Then check PHP error log for these messages
// If they show empty '', this is the issue
```
