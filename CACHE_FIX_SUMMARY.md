# Cache Utility - Unserialize Error Fix

## Problem Description
The application was experiencing PHP warnings:
- `Warning: unserialize(): Error at offset 208 of 963 bytes in /app/app/utilities/CacheUtility.php on line 31`
- `Warning: Trying to access array offset on false in /app/app/utilities/CacheUtility.php on line 34`

## Root Cause Analysis
The issues were caused by:

1. **Corrupted Serialized Data**: Cache files could become corrupted due to:
   - Interrupted write operations
   - File system issues
   - Application crashes during serialization
   - Incompatible data serialization

2. **Missing Error Handling**: The original code did not:
   - Check if `unserialize()` succeeded
   - Validate the structure of unserialized data
   - Handle exceptions gracefully
   - Clean up corrupted files

3. **Array Access on False**: When `unserialize()` failed and returned `false`, the code tried to access array offsets (`$data['expires']`), causing "Trying to access array offset on false" warning

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `get()` Method
- Added try-catch error handling
- Added validation that `unserialize()` was successful
- Added structure validation for unserialized data
- Automatically delete corrupted cache files
- Return `false` gracefully on errors

```php
// Before: Direct access without validation
$data = unserialize(file_get_contents($file));
if (time() > $data['expires']) { ... }

// After: Robust error handling
$data = @unserialize($content, ['allowed_classes' => false]);
if ($data === false) {
    $this->delete($key);
    return false;
}
if (!is_array($data) || !isset($data['expires'])) {
    $this->delete($key);
    return false;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced `set()` Method
- Added try-catch error handling
- Added verification of serialization success
- Test unserialization before writing to disk
- Add version field for future compatibility
- Log errors for debugging

### 3. Enhanced `getStats()` Method
- Added robust error handling for each file
- Added file validation checks
- Added `corrupted_entries` counter
- Skip invalid files instead of crashing
- Comprehensive exception handling

### 4. New `clearCorrupted()` Method
- Identifies and removes corrupted cache entries
- Logs the number of removed files
- Safe exception handling
- Returns count of cleared entries

### 5. Security Improvements
- Use `@unserialize()` with restricted class loading
- Added `'allowed_classes' => false` option
- Prevents object injection attacks
- Validates all unserialized data

## Files Modified
- `app/utilities/CacheUtility.php` - Core cache utility with enhanced error handling

## Files Added
- `cache_maintenance.php` - One-time maintenance script to clean corrupted cache

## Usage

### Running the Maintenance Script
Clean up existing corrupted cache entries:
```bash
php cache_maintenance.php
```

Output:
```
=== Cache Maintenance Tool ===

Before cleanup:
  - Total files: 45
  - Valid entries: 42
  - Expired entries: 2
  - Corrupted entries: 1
  - Total size: 125.45 KB

Cleaning corrupted cache entries...
Removed 1 corrupted cache file(s)

After cleanup:
  - Total files: 44
  - Valid entries: 42
  - Expired entries: 2
  - Corrupted entries: 0
  - Total size: 125.23 KB

✅ Cache maintenance complete!
```

### Using the Cache Utility
The cache utility now safely handles errors:

```php
$cache = new CacheUtility();

// Get - handles corrupted files gracefully
$data = $cache->get('my_key'); // Returns false if corrupted

// Set - verifies serialization before writing
$success = $cache->set('my_key', $data, 3600);

// Remember - safe callback pattern
$data = $cache->remember('stats_key', 3600, function() {
    return expensiveOperation();
});

// Get stats - shows health of cache
$stats = $cache->getStats();
echo $stats['corrupted_entries']; // Shows number of corrupted files

// Clean up corrupted files
$cleared = $cache->clearCorrupted();
echo "Removed $cleared corrupted entries";
```

## Technical Details

### Serialization Safety
- Restricted class loading prevents object injection
- Data structure validation on deserialization
- Automatic cleanup of invalid data

### Error Recovery
- Corrupted files are automatically deleted on access
- Failed writes return false (no partial data)
- All operations gracefully degrade

### Logging
- Cache read errors logged to error_log
- Cache write errors logged to error_log
- Corruption cleanup logged with count
- Stats operation errors logged

## Benefits
✅ Eliminates "unserialize() Error" warnings
✅ Eliminates "Trying to access array offset on false" warnings
✅ Automatic cleanup of corrupted cache
✅ Graceful error handling throughout
✅ Enhanced security with class loading restrictions
✅ Better visibility into cache health
✅ Easy maintenance with cleanup script

## Deployment Steps
1. Update `app/utilities/CacheUtility.php` with new code
2. Run `php cache_maintenance.php` to clean existing corrupted cache
3. Monitor error logs to ensure no new corruption occurs
4. Cache operations now proceed safely without warnings

## Testing Recommendations
- Test with corrupted cache files to verify cleanup
- Test serialization/deserialization with various data types
- Test with large cache files
- Verify error_log messages appear correctly

## Monitoring
Monitor your error logs for:
- "Cache read error for key" messages
- "Cache write error for key" messages
- "Cache stats error" messages
- "Cache cleanup: Removed X corrupted entries" messages

These indicate potential cache issues that may need investigation.
