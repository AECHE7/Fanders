# 🚀 SLR System - Ready for Production

## ✅ What We Accomplished

### 1. Complete Database Infrastructure
- **3 new tables** created with full audit capabilities
- **22 columns** in slr_documents for comprehensive tracking

- **10 columns** in slr_access_log for complete audit trail

### 2. Docker-Based Migration Success
```bash
# Same reliable approach as collection sheets
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app php:8.2-cli bash -lc "..."
```
- Fresh environment with PostgreSQL extensions
- No local PHP dependencies required
- Consistent execution across platforms

### 3. Production-Ready Features
- **File integrity verification** (SHA-256 hashing)
- **Role-based access control** (super-admin, admin, manager, etc.)
- **Complete audit logging** (every access tracked)
- **Flexible generation rules** (auto/manual triggers)
- **Document lifecycle management** (active/archived/replaced)
