# Centralize Export/Report Functionality

## Tasks to Complete:
- [x] Remove export button and JavaScript from `templates/transactions/list.php`
- [x] Remove export button and JavaScript from `templates/cash_blotter/list.php`
- [x] Verify that reports module (`templates/reports/list.php`) remains intact as centralized location

## Current Status:
- Identified 2 templates with export functionality that need to be cleaned up
- Reports module already serves as centralized reporting hub
- All other list templates (clients, users, admins, loans, payments, collection sheets) already lack export functionality

## Testing Plan:
- Verify export buttons are removed from affected pages
- Confirm reports page still functions properly
- Test that users can still access all reports through the centralized reports module
