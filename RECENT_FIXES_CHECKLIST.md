```

This will:

- Identify corrupted entries
- Remove corrupted cache
- Display before/after statistics
- Log cleanup results

### Monitor Logs:
```bash
# Watch for CSRF errors
tail -f /var/log/php-errors.log | grep -i csrf

# Watch for cache errors
tail -f /var/log/php-errors.log | grep -i cache

# Watch for general errors
tail -f /var/log/php-errors.log
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Test CSRF Fix:
1. Navigate to Client Management â†’ Add New Client
2. Fill in client information
3. Click "Create Client"
4. Expected: Client created successfully without "Invalid security token" error
5. Repeat 2-3 times rapidly to test double-submission prevention

### Test Cache Fix:
1. Monitor error logs for any unserialize warnings
2. Expected: No warnings about cache serialization
3. Run `php cache_maintenance.php`
4. Expected: Shows clean cache statistics

### Test Session Management:
1. Log in to the system
2. Leave idle for 5 minutes
3. Try to perform an action
4. Expected: Session timeout modal appears (if configured)
5. Expected: Can extend session or logout without errors

## Known Limitations & Notes

### CSRF Fix:
- Session timeout checks run independently (no CSRF)
- Token refresh happens every 10 minutes
- Tokens don't regenerate during form submission
- Double-submission prevention works at browser level

### Cache Fix:
- Corrupted files are automatically deleted on access
- Maintenance script recommended for initial cleanup
- All cache operations log errors for monitoring
- Object deserialization is restricted for security

---

## Rollback Instructions (If Needed)

### To rollback to previous version:
```bash
# Revert CSRF fix
git revert 1874c2e

# Revert cache fix
git revert d098ddc

# Revert documentation
git revert d02caeb
```

However, **rollback is NOT recommended** as both fixes resolve critical issues.
