6. System Models
6.1 Data Flow Models
Payment Processing Data Flow
The payment processing workflow begins with Payment Entry, where cashiers input
client ID, payment amount, and date. The system validates the payment information and creates
a payment record, then proceeds to Balance Update where the payment amount and current
balance are processed to calculate the new outstanding balance. The updated balance triggers

History Update, where the payment record is appended to the client's payment history,
maintaining chronological order. The process continues with Cash Blotter Update, where
payment data is added to the daily cash totals, affecting the branch's cash position. Finally,
Notification Check evaluates the updated balance against the payment schedule to determine if
alerts are needed for overdue or upcoming payments.
Loan Creation Data Flow
The loan creation process starts with Application Entry, where client details and loan
amount are input and validated according to credit policies, creating an application record.
Interest Calculation then applies business rules to the principal amount, calculating the total
interest using the standard 5% monthly rate over 4 months. Schedule Generation takes the
total amount including principal, interest, and fees to calculate the 17-week payment schedule
with weekly amounts. The Approval Process involves management review of the complete
application, resulting in approval or rejection status with proper authorization checks. Upon
approval, Disbursement releases funds to the client, creating a disbursement record and
updating the cash blotter.

6.2 Object Models
Core System Objects
The Client object contains ID, name, address, contact information, and status attributes,
with methods to create, update, and validate client information. Clients have a one-to-many
relationship with loans, allowing multiple loans per client over time.
The Loan object includes ID, client_id, principal, interest, term, and status attributes,
with methods to calculate payments, process approvals, and manage disbursements. Each loan
belongs to one client and has many associated payments.
The Payment object contains ID, loan_id, amount, date, and method attributes, with
methods to record, validate, and process payment transactions. Each payment belongs to one
specific loan.

The CashBlotter object includes date, opening_balance, collections, and releases
attributes, with methods to generate daily summaries, calculate balances, and close daily
operations. Cash blotters contain multiple transaction references.
The User object contains ID, username, role, and permissions attributes, with methods
for authentication and authorization. Users perform multiple transactions, maintaining
accountability through audit trails.
The Transactions object contains ID, type, amount, and timestamp with many-to-one
relationships to users, estimated at 100,000 records annually including all system activities.

6.3 State Models
Loan Status State Machine

Loans progress through defined states based on specific events and validation criteria.
The Application state transitions to Approved upon receiving management approval with
proper authorization, triggering payment schedule generation. Approved loans move to Active
status upon disbursement, requiring cash availability verification and cash blotter updates.
Active loans remain active with each payment received, or transition to Completed upon final
payment when balance reaches zero. Active loans may transition to Overdue status when
payment deadlines pass, generating automatic alerts. Overdue loans return to Active status
upon payment receipt and processing. All state transitions require proper validation and trigger
appropriate system actions.
