## 🚫 What If I Don't See Password Fields?

If you see this message:
> "Only super-admins can change super-admin passwords"

**Reason:** You're trying to edit a super-admin account without super-admin privileges.

**Solution:** Contact a super-admin for help.

## 📁 Modified Files

1. ✅ `/templates/users/form.php` - Added conditional password fields
2. ✅ `/public/users/edit.php` - Added permission checks
3. ✅ `/public/users/reset_pw.php` - Deprecated (redirects to edit)

## 🎯 Security Benefits

1. **No Password Display** - Passwords never shown on screen
2. **Role-Based Access** - Clear permission hierarchy  
3. **Super-Admin Protection** - Can't be edited by non-super-admins
4. **Audit Trail** - All changes logged
5. **User Choice** - Control over password changes

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Empty = No Change**: Leaving password fields empty preserves the current password
- **Both Fields Required**: Must fill both "Password" and "Confirm Password" if changing
- **Match Required**: Both password fields must match
- **Immediate Effect**: Password changes take effect immediately after update

## 🔗 Old Links Still Work

Old bookmarks to `reset_pw.php` automatically redirect to the edit page with a helpful message.
