## 🚀 ENHANCED FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **LoanCalculationService Enhancement**
**File:** `app/services/LoanCalculationService.php`

#### New Constants:
```php
const INTEREST_RATE = 0.05;                    // 5% monthly interest
const INSURANCE_FEE = 425.00;                  // ₱425 insurance fee
const SAVINGS_RATE = 0.01;                     // 1% savings deduction
const DEFAULT_WEEKS_IN_LOAN = 17;             // Default term
const DEFAULT_LOAN_TERM_MONTHS = 4;           // Default months
```

#### Enhanced Methods:
- `calculateLoan($principal, $weeks, $months)` - Main calculation with flexible terms
- `calculateLoanFromConversationalTerm($principal, $term)` - Parse "3 months", etc.
- `generatePaymentSchedule($calculation)` - Weekly payment breakdown
- `parseConversationalTerm($term)` - Convert text to weeks/months
- `formatCalculationSummary($calculation)` - UI-ready formatted output
- `getCommonLoanTerms()` - Predefined term options

### 2. **Calculation Formula**
```
Total Loan Amount = Principal + Interest + Insurance + Savings

Where:
- Interest = Principal × 5% × Number of Months
- Insurance = ₱425.00 (fixed fee)
- Savings = Principal × 1% (deduction)
- Weekly Payment = Total Loan Amount ÷ Number of Weeks
```

### 3. **Payment Schedule Generation**
Each payment includes:
- Week number and due date
- Principal payment portion
- Interest payment portion
- Insurance payment portion (distributed weekly)
- Savings payment portion (distributed weekly)
- Total expected payment
