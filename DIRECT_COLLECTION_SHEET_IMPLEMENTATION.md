## 🔄 Workflow Comparison

### **Traditional Workflow (AO + Cashier)**
```
AO Creates Draft → Submits Sheet → Cashier Approves → Cashier Posts → Payments Recorded
     ↓              ↓                ↓               ↓              ↓
  draft →      submitted →       approved →      posted →     payments logged
```

### **Direct Workflow (Super-Admin Only)**
```
Super-Admin Creates Draft → Direct Post → Payments Recorded Immediately
          ↓                        ↓                    ↓
       draft →                 posted →          payments logged
```

## 🛡️ Security & Authorization

### **Access Control:**
- ✅ Only `super-admin` role can access direct posting
- ✅ Authorization check in both UI and service layer
- ✅ CSRF protection maintained
- ✅ Proper error handling for unauthorized access

### **Audit Trail:**
- ✅ All direct posts logged as `collection_sheet_direct_posted`
- ✅ Includes bypassed approval flag
- ✅ Full transaction details captured
- ✅ IP address and user tracking

---

## 📊 Database Changes

### **No Schema Changes Required**
- Uses existing `collection_sheets` and `collection_sheet_items` tables
- Leverages existing payment recording infrastructure
- Compatible with current transaction logging system

### **New Transaction Log Action:**
```sql
-- Direct posting creates this log entry
INSERT INTO transaction_logs (
    entity_type, entity_id, action, user_id, details, ip_address, timestamp
) VALUES (
    'system', {sheet_id}, 'collection_sheet_direct_posted', {super_admin_id},
    '{"total_amount": 1500.00, "posted_items": 3, "bypassed_approval": true}',
    '{ip_address}', NOW()
);
```

## 🎨 User Experience
