## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Operations (Must Track)
1. **Loan approval** - Financial decision point
2. **Loan cancellation/rejection** - Risk management
3. **Payment approval** - Financial validation
4. **User role changes** - Security audit
5. **Password changes** - Security audit

### Priority 2: Data Integrity (Should Track)
6. Update operations (clients, loans, payments)
7. Delete operations (all entities)
8. SLR generation (document creation)

### Priority 3: Audit Completeness (Nice to Track)
9. View operations (sensitive data access)
10. Collection sheet creation/approval workflow
11. Email/notification sends
