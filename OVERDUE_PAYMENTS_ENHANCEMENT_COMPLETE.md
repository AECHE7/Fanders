ow t# Overdue Payments Analysis & Enhanced Interface Implementation

## Analysis Complete: How Overdue Payments Are Tracked

### Current Overdue Payment Tracking System

1. **Location**: `/workspaces/Fanders/app/services/ReportService.php` - `generateOverdueReport()` method
2. **Logic**: 
   - Identifies loans with status 'active'
   - Compares `completion_date` (expected completion) with current date
   - Calculates `days_overdue` as `(CURRENT_DATE - completion_date)`
   - Filters loans with remaining balance > 0

3. **Data Retrieved**:
   - Loan details (ID, client info, amounts)
   - Payment totals and remaining balance
   - Days overdue calculation
   - Client contact information

4. **Current Interface**: Basic table at `/public/payments/overdue_loans.php`

## Implemented Fixes & Enhancements

### 1. ✅ Conversational Loan Terms

**Problem**: "17 weeks" term was displayed in technical format during loan creation.

**Solution**: 
- Created `LoanTermHelper` utility class at `/app/utilities/LoanTermHelper.php`
- Converts numeric weeks to conversational terms:
  - 4 weeks → "1 month (4 weeks)"
  - 17 weeks → "4+ months (17 weeks) - Standard"
  - 26 weeks → "6+ months (26 weeks)"
  - etc.

**Files Modified**:
- `/templates/loans/form.php` - Replaced numeric input with dropdown of common terms
- `/public/loans/add.php` - Enhanced term display in calculation preview
- Added custom term option for flexibility (4-52 weeks)

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Overdue Payments Interface

**Replaced**: Basic overdue loans table
**Created**: Comprehensive Overdue Payments Dashboard at `/public/payments/overdue_payments.php`

3. **Enhanced Data Display**:
   - Payment progress bars showing percentage paid

4. **Advanced Filtering**:

## Technical Implementation Details

### LoanTermHelper Class
```php
class LoanTermHelper {
    public static function weeksToConversational($weeks);
    public static function getCommonTermOptions();
}
```

### Enhanced Overdue Data Structure
```php
$loan = [
    // Original fields...
    'severity' => 'low|medium|high',
    'severity_label' => 'Recently Overdue|Moderately Overdue|Critically Overdue',
    'severity_class' => 'warning|danger|dark',
    'percentage_paid' => 65.3, // Percentage of total amount paid
    'expected_weekly' => 712.06, // Expected weekly payment
    'weeks_behind' => 2.1 // Calculated weeks behind schedule
];
```
