1. **`app/services/LoanCalculationService.php`**
   - Added `MIN_LOAN_AMOUNT = 5000.00` constant
   - Added `MAX_LOAN_AMOUNT = 50000.00` constant  
   - Enhanced `validateLoanAmount()` method with dynamic limits
   - Added `getLoanAmountLimits()` helper for UI integration

2. **`app/services/LoanService.php`**
   - ✅ Already uses `LoanCalculationService::validateLoanAmount()`
   - ✅ Automatically enforces new limits (no changes needed)

### ✅ **Frontend Forms**
3. **`templates/loans/form.php`**
   - Updated HTML5 `min` attribute from `1000` to `5000`
   - Made limits dynamic using `getLoanAmountLimits()`
   - Updated help text: "Minimum ₱5,000 - Maximum ₱50,000"
   - Updated validation messages with dynamic limits

4. **`public/loans/add.php`**
   - ✅ Uses `LoanCalculationService::validateLoanAmount()`
   - ✅ Automatically enforces new limits (no changes needed)

5. **`public/loans/edit.php`**
   - ✅ Uses loan form template with updated validation
   - ✅ Inherits new limits automatically

### ✅ **API Endpoints**
6. **`public/api/get_loan_config.php`** (NEW)
   - Returns current loan limits and business rules
   - Provides dynamic configuration for AJAX/UI updates
   - Authentication required (staff roles only)

7. **`public/api/calculate_loan.php`** (NEW)
   - Real-time loan calculation with validation
   - Enforces new limits via API calls
   - JSON response with detailed validation errors

## 🔄 VALIDATION FLOW

### **Request Flow:**
```
User Input → HTML5 Validation → Server Validation → Database
    ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
 (min=5000)   (Frontend)      (LoanCalculationService)  (No constraints)
```

### **Validation Layers:**
1. **Client-Side (HTML5):** `min="5000"` `max="50000"`
2. **Server-Side (PHP):** `LoanCalculationService::validateLoanAmount()`
3. **API Layer:** Same validation for all endpoints
4. **Service Layer:** Centralized in `LoanCalculationService`

## 📊 TESTING RESULTS

### **Test Cases Verified:**
| Amount | Expected | Status | Validation Message |
|--------|----------|--------|--------------------|
| ₱4,999 | ❌ FAIL | ✅ Pass | "Loan amount must be at least ₱5,000." |
| ₱5,000 | ✅ PASS | ✅ Pass | Valid |
| ₱25,000 | ✅ PASS | ✅ Pass | Valid |
| ₱50,000 | ✅ PASS | ✅ Pass | Valid |
| ₱50,001 | ❌ FAIL | ✅ Pass | "Loan amount cannot exceed ₱50,000." |

### **All Endpoints Tested:**
- ✅ Loan creation form (`/public/loans/add.php`)
- ✅ Loan editing form (`/public/loans/edit.php`)
- ✅ API calculation endpoint (`/public/api/calculate_loan.php`)
- ✅ API configuration endpoint (`/public/api/get_loan_config.php`)
- ✅ Backend service validation (`LoanService::applyForLoan()`)

## 🎯 KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### **Dynamic Limits:**
```php
// Old (Hardcoded):
min="1000" max="50000"
"Minimum ₱1,000 - Maximum ₱50,000"

// New (Dynamic):
min="<?= $loanLimits['minimum'] ?>"
max="<?= $loanLimits['maximum'] ?>"
"<?= $loanLimits['range_display'] ?>"
```

### **Centralized Validation:**
```php
// All endpoints now use:
$loanCalcService->validateLoanAmount($amount)

// Returns dynamic error messages:
"Loan amount must be at least ₱5,000."
"Loan amount cannot exceed ₱50,000."
```

### **API Integration Ready:**
```javascript
// Frontend can fetch current limits:
GET /public/api/get_loan_config.php
{
  "loan_limits": {
    "minimum": 5000,
    "maximum": 50000,
    "range_display": "₱5,000 - ₱50,000"
  }
}
```
