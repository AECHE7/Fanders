## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps for Your Deployment

### For DevOps/Operations Team
1. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
2. Verify new files are present
3. Check that `/public/loans/add.php` has the logging statements
4. Restart PHP-FPM if needed
5. Monitor error logs for diagnostic messages

### For Testing
1. Test loan creation workflow
2. Monitor PHP error logs for:
   - "Loan submission attempt"
   - "Loan creation failed"
   - "Loan created successfully"
3. Capture any error messages that appear

### For Future Debugging
- Refer to LOAN_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md when issues arise
- Use test scripts in `/` root for end-to-end testing
- Check LOAN_CODE_TRACE.md to understand execution flow
- Reference LOAN_ERROR_DIAGNOSIS.md for error interpretation
