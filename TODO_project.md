- [ ] public/clients/view.php - Complete loan history integration
- [ ] public/clients/reset_pw.php - Decide on password reset for clients

#### Payments Controllers
- [ ] public/payments/list.php - Update to use PaymentService
- [ ] public/payments/view.php - Payment details view
- [ ] public/payments/edit.php - Payment editing (if allowed)
- [ ] public/payments/delete.php - Payment deletion logic

### 2. Template Updates
- [ ] templates/clients/ - Create/update client-specific templates
- [ ] templates/loans/ - Ensure all loan templates exist
- [ ] templates/payments/ - Complete payment templates
- [ ] templates/dashboard/ - Update for accurate statistics

### 3. Advanced Features Implementation
#### Cash Blotter
- [ ] Daily cash flow tracking
- [ ] Inflow/outflow calculations
- [ ] Balance reconciliation

#### Audit & Security

- [ ] Automated backups
- [ ] Session timeout handling
- [ ] Data integrity validation

#### Reporting
- [ ] Loan summary reports
- [ ] Payment transaction reports
- [ ] Client portfolio reports
- [ ] PDF/Excel export functionality

### 4. Testing & Quality Assurance
#### Unit Testing
- [ ] Test LoanService business rules
- [ ] Test PaymentService calculations
- [ ] Test ClientService validations
- [ ] Test Model CRUD operations

#### Integration Testing
- [ ] End-to-end loan workflow
- [ ] Payment processing scenarios
- [ ] Multi-user concurrent operations
- [ ] Database transaction integrity

#### User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Admin workflow testing
- [ ] Cashier payment recording
- [ ] Account officer client management
- [ ] Manager approval processes

### 5. Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] User manuals for each role
- [ ] API documentation (if applicable)
- [ ] Database schema documentation
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures

## Dependencies & Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4+ with MySQL
- Composer for dependency management
- Node.js for frontend assets (if needed)
- Web server (Apache/Nginx) with proper configuration
- SSL certificate for production
- Database backup solution

## Risk Assessment
### High Risk
- Payment calculation errors could lead to financial losses
- Database corruption during concurrent operations
- Security vulnerabilities in authentication

### Medium Risk
- Incomplete controller conversions may break workflows
- Template inconsistencies affect user experience
- Missing validation could allow invalid data entry

### Low Risk
- Advanced features can be implemented incrementally
- UI improvements are cosmetic and don't affect functionality

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All core loan workflows function correctly
- [ ] Payment calculations are 100% accurate
- [ ] Data integrity maintained across all operations
- [ ] Role-based access control enforced
- [ ] System handles concurrent users without issues
- [ ] All business rules implemented and tested
- [ ] User interface is intuitive and responsive
- [ ] System performance meets requirements

## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 1 controller integrations
2. Implement comprehensive testing
3. Begin Phase 2 advanced features
4. Conduct user acceptance testing
5. Deploy to production environment

## Notes
- Phase 1 focuses on core functionality to get the system operational
- Phase 2 adds advanced features for full compliance and efficiency
- Phase 3 ensures quality and reliability
- Regular backups and testing should be performed throughout development
