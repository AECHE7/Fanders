# Client Deletion Fix - October 27, 2025

## Problem Description
Clients could not be deleted even when they had no active loans. The system was incorrectly blocking deletion for clients who should have been eligible for deletion.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the client deletion logic with two main problems:

1. **Case Sensitivity Issue**: The `ClientModel.getClientCurrentLoans()` method used a hardcoded case-sensitive check `l.status = 'Active'`, while the `LoanModel` methods had been updated to use case-insensitive comparisons.

2. **Incomplete Status Checking**: The method only checked for 'Active' loans but should also prevent deletion for loans in 'Application' and 'Approved' statuses, which are also active/pending states.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/workspaces/Fanders/app/models/ClientModel.php`
**Method:** `getClientCurrentLoans($clientId)`

**Before:**
```php
public function getClientCurrentLoans($clientId) {
    $sql = "SELECT l.*
            FROM loans l
            WHERE l.client_id = ? AND l.status = 'Active'
            ORDER BY l.created_at DESC";

    return $this->db->resultSet($sql, [$clientId]);
}
```

**After:**
```php
public function getClientCurrentLoans($clientId) {
    $sql = "SELECT l.*
            FROM loans l
            WHERE l.client_id = ? AND LOWER(l.status) IN (LOWER('Application'), LOWER('Approved'), LOWER('Active'))
            ORDER BY l.created_at DESC";

    return $this->db->resultSet($sql, [$clientId]);
}
```

**Changes Made:**
- Added case-insensitive comparison using `LOWER()`
- Extended check to include `Application`, `Approved`, and `Active` statuses
- Updated documentation to clarify the method's purpose

### 2. `/workspaces/Fanders/app/services/ClientService.php`
**Method:** `deleteClient($id)`

**Before:**
```php
$activeLoans = $this->clientModel->getClientCurrentLoans($id);
if (!empty($activeLoans)) {
    $this->setErrorMessage('Cannot delete client with active loans. Please deactivate instead.');
    return false;
}
```

**After:**
```php
$activeLoans = $this->clientModel->getClientCurrentLoans($id);
if (!empty($activeLoans)) {
    $loanStatuses = array_unique(array_column($activeLoans, 'status'));
    $statusList = implode(', ', $loanStatuses);
    $this->setErrorMessage("Cannot delete client with active/pending loans (Status: {$statusList}). Only clients with Completed or Defaulted loans can be deleted. Consider deactivating the client instead.");
    return false;
}
```

**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced error message to show which specific loan statuses are blocking deletion
- Made it clear that only clients with `Completed` or `Defaulted` loans can be deleted

## Business Logic
The updated client deletion logic now follows this rule:

**Clients CAN be deleted if:**
- They have no loans at all, OR
- They only have loans with status `Completed` or `Defaulted`

**Clients CANNOT be deleted if:**
- They have loans with status `Application` (pending review)
- They have loans with status `Approved` (approved, pending disbursement)
- They have loans with status `Active` (disbursed and payments are due)

## Testing
The fix addresses the case sensitivity issue that was preventing proper loan status detection. Now:

1. Loan statuses are compared case-insensitively
2. All relevant active/pending loan statuses are checked
3. Clear error messages inform users why deletion was blocked
4. Only truly inactive clients (with no active business) can be deleted

## Impact
- ✅ Clients without active/pending loans can now be deleted
- ✅ System properly protects against deleting clients with ongoing business relationships
- ✅ Better user experience with descriptive error messages
- ✅ Consistent with the case-insensitive approach used in LoanModel

## Verification
To verify the fix is working:

1. Try to delete a client with an active loan → Should be blocked with descriptive error
2. Try to delete a client with only completed loans → Should succeed
3. Try to delete a client with no loans → Should succeed
4. Error messages should show which loan statuses are preventing deletion
