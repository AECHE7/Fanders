# Password Management Update

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Feature:** Updated Password Change System

## Overview

Replaced the random password reset feature with a more secure and user-friendly approach where passwords can be changed directly through the user edit form.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Removed Random Password Reset Feature**

**Previous Behavior:**
- Admins could click "Reset Password" button
- System generated a random password
- Password displayed in alert popup (security risk)

**New Behavior:**
- Password fields integrated into the edit user form
- Passwords can be left empty to keep existing password
- More control over password changes

### 2. **Updated Permission System**

#### Password Change Permissions:

| User Role | Can Change Own Password | Can Change Staff Password | Can Change Super-Admin Password |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Super-Admin** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Admin** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (Manager, Cashier, Account Officer only) | ❌ No |
| **Manager** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Cashier** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Account Officer** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |

#### Key Security Rules:

1. **Super-Admin Protection**: Only super-admins can change super-admin passwords
2. **Self-Service**: All users can change their own passwords
3. **Admin Limitations**: Admins can only change passwords of operational staff (Manager, Cashier, Account Officer)
4. **Role Preservation**: Admins cannot change user roles when editing

### 3. **Files Modified**

#### `/templates/users/form.php`
- ✅ Removed "Reset Password" button
- ✅ Added password fields with conditional display
- ✅ Shows appropriate messages based on permissions
- ✅ Password fields only shown when user has permission
- ✅ Removed reset password button styling

**Changes:**
```php
// New permission logic
$canEditPassword = $create || $isEditingSelf || $isSuperAdminEditingOthers;

// Prevent staff from editing super-admin passwords
if ($editUser['role'] === 'super-admin' && $currentUser['role'] !== 'super-admin') {
    $canEditPassword = false;
}
```

#### `/public/users/edit.php`
- ✅ Added permission check for super-admin account editing
- ✅ Added password change permission validation
- ✅ Prevents non-super-admins from changing super-admin passwords
- ✅ Proper error handling for unauthorized password changes

**New Checks:**
```php
// Cannot edit super-admin accounts unless you are super-admin
if ($editUser['role'] === 'super-admin' && $userRole !== 'super-admin') {
    $session->setFlash('error', 'You do not have permission to edit super-admin accounts.');
    header('Location: ' . APP_URL . '/public/users/index.php');
    exit;
}

// Password change permissions
if ($editUser['role'] === 'super-admin' && $userRole !== 'super-admin') {
    $canChangePassword = false;
    $error = 'You do not have permission to change super-admin passwords.';
}
```

#### `/public/users/reset_pw.php`
- ✅ Deprecated the random password reset functionality
- ✅ File now redirects to edit page with informational message
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility for existing links

### 4. **User Experience Improvements**

#### For Super-Admins:
- ✅ Full control over all user accounts
- ✅ Can change any user's password through edit form
- ✅ Clear indication of password change capability

#### For Admins:
- ✅ Can change passwords of operational staff
- ✅ Cannot modify super-admin accounts
- ✅ Clear error messages when attempting unauthorized actions

#### For Operational Staff:
- ✅ Can change their own password
- ✅ Cannot change other users' passwords
- ✅ Informative messages about password restrictions

### 5. **Security Enhancements**

1. **No More Password Display**: Random passwords are no longer generated and displayed in popups
2. **Controlled Access**: Clear permission hierarchy prevents unauthorized password changes
3. **Super-Admin Protection**: Super-admin accounts protected from modification by lower-level users
4. **Audit Trail**: Password changes logged through existing update mechanism
5. **Optional Updates**: Empty password fields preserve existing passwords

## How to Use

### Changing Your Own Password:
1. Navigate to Users → Your Profile → Edit
2. Enter new password in "Password" field
3. Confirm password in "Confirm Password" field
4. Leave empty to keep current password
5. Click "Update Account"

### Changing Another User's Password (Super-Admin Only):
1. Navigate to Users → Select User → Edit
2. Enter new password in "Password" field
3. Confirm password in "Confirm Password" field
4. Leave empty to keep current password
5. Click "Update Account"

### If Permission Denied:
- **Editing Super-Admin**: Only super-admins can edit super-admin accounts
- **Changing Passwords**: Follow the permission matrix above
- **Contact Administrator**: Request super-admin assistance if needed

## Benefits

1. ✅ **More Secure**: No random passwords displayed in alerts
2. ✅ **User-Friendly**: Familiar form-based password changes

4. ✅ **Protected**: Super-admin accounts secured from unauthorized changes
