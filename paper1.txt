Loaning Management System
Requirements Specification
Client: Fanders Microfinance Inc.
Document Version: 1.0
Date: October 16, 2025
Purpose: This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for the
Loaning Management System (LMS) designed to replace the current Excel-based operations
at Fanders Microfinance Inc.

Project Title & Introduction
The Loaning Management System (LMS) for Fanders Microfinance Inc. is a
comprehensive digital solution intended to streamline loan monitoring, payment processing,
and financial reporting. Its primary purpose is to address critical business pain points,
including:
●​ Eliminating calculation errors caused by manual data entry.
●​ Ensuring data integrity and providing secure, centralized storage.
●​ Automating the creation of cash blotters and financial statements.
The system will encompass the entire loan lifecycle, from initial application entry and approval
to final payment processing and reporting, providing reliable data for management decisions.

3. Loan Management
This module replaces the Book Management section and covers the core financial operations:

Create Loan Record (FR-001)
●​ Input Fields: Client Information (Linked to Client Account), Principal Amount, Loan Term
(Fixed at 4 months/17 weeks).
●​ Processing: The system generates a unique loan identifier and validates input.
●​ Automated Calculations (FR-002, FR-009):

○​ Interest: Automatically calculated as Principal (5% monthly interest over 4 months).
○​ Fees: Fixed Insurance Fee of ₱425.
○​ Total Amount Due: Principal + Interest + Insurance Fee.
●​ Payment Schedule Generation (FR-003): Automatically generates a 17-week schedule
by dividing the Total Amount Due by 17.

View & Track Loans (UR-001)
●​ A comprehensive view of each loan, including the complete 17-week payment schedule,
principal, interest, fees, and the running Outstanding Balance (FR-005).
●​ Status tracking: Loans must progress through states: Applied Approved Fund
Disbursed (Active) Fully Paid (Closed) or Missed Payment (Overdue) Defaulted.

4. Client Management (Borrowers)
This module handles the non-financial records of Fanders Microfinance Inc. clients.
●​ Create Client Account: Fields must include Full Name, Email Address, Phone Number,
and Physical Address.
●​ View Client Account: Displays detailed client information, account status
(Active/Inactive), and a comprehensive list of all associated loans, including:
○​ Loan Status (Active, Overdue, Closed).
○​ Last Payment Date and Amount.
○​ Current Outstanding Balance.
●​ Update Client Account: Managers and Administrators can modify profiles. Clients
should be able to modify their own non-critical profile information.
●​ Deactivate Client: Client accounts should be deactivated (not deleted) to preserve
historical loan and payment records. Deactivated clients cannot submit new loan
applications.

5. Transaction Management (Loan Releases & Payments)
The heart of the system, managing the inflow and outflow of funds and ensuring real-time
balance updates.

Loan Release (Disbursement) (FR-007)
●​ Admins/Managers confirm the release of funds to the client.
●​ Process: Records the disbursement, generates the SLR document, and immediately
updates the Digital Cash Blotter (FR-006) to reflect the cash outflow.

Payment Recording (FR-004)
●​ Cashiers or Account Officers record weekly client payments.
●​ Process: The system accepts Client ID, payment amount, and date. It validates the
payment against the schedule and updates the Outstanding Balance in real-time
(FR-005).
●​ Audit Trail: Every payment entry must be timestamped and logged to the Transactions

entity (FR-010).
●​ Cash Blotter Update: Payment data is instantly added to the Digital Cash Blotter to
reflect cash inflow (FR-006).

Overdue Detection & Alerts (FR-012)
●​ The system automatically flags an account as Overdue if a scheduled payment date is
missed.
●​ Alerts: Generates automatic alerts for staff/management for payments that are 1 day
overdue and 1 week in advance of the due date.

6. Admin Management (Administrator Only)
The Administrator role provides the highest level of system control and security oversight.
●​ Create/Update User (Manager/Cashier/Account Officer): Manages all non-client user
accounts, including role assignment and status (Active/Inactive).
●​ Reset Password: Administrator can trigger a password reset for any user by generating
a secure temporary password.
●​ Deactivate User: Non-client user accounts should be deactivated (not permanently
deleted) to preserve the accountability of actions logged in the audit trail.
●​ Financial Reporting (FR-005): Accesses all financial reports, including the capability to
export transactions and financial statements to PDF and Excel formats.

7. Account Security Features
The system must meet high security and reliability standards:
●​ Password Security: User passwords must be securely hashed (e.g., using Bcrypt) and
salted.
●​ Session Management: Implement secure session controls with a period of inactivity
leading to automatic logout.
●​ Data Integrity: All financial transactions must maintain 100% accuracy, protected
through validation and rollback mechanisms.
●​ Audit Logging (FR-010): The system must log 100% of user activities and data changes
to maintain a complete and traceable audit trail.
●​ Automated Backup (UR-008): Daily automated backups of the database to a secure
cloud storage location are mandatory.

Database Structure
The underlying data model uses a relational database system (MySQL/PHP) designed for data
integrity and efficient transaction processing.
