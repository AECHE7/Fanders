• Client management with eligibility verification and status tracking
• Multi-role user management (Administrator, Manager, Cashier, Account Officer)
• Automated financial calculations using fixed business rules
• Payment processing with real-time balance updates
• Digital cash blotter with daily reconciliation
• Comprehensive reporting with PDF/Excel export capabilities
• Audit trail maintenance for all system activities
• Collection sheet workflow for field operations

<Describe the data objects and the relationships between them (e.g., Entity-Relationship Diagram reference).>

The system employs a PostgreSQL relational database with strict referential integrity and optimized for financial transaction processing. The data model implements a comprehensive microfinance operation structure:

Core Entity Relationships:
• Users (1) → Transactions (Many): Complete audit trail for accountability
• Clients (1) → Loans (Many): Multiple loans per client over time (one active maximum)
• Loans (1) → Payments (Many): 17 payments per loan with flexible early completion
• Users (Many) → Payments (Many): Payment recording attribution for cashier/AO tracking
• Cash Blotter (1) → Daily Transactions (Many): Daily cash position reconciliation

Extended Operational Relationships:
• Collection Sheets (1) → Collection Items (Many): Field collection workflow
• SLR Documents (1) → Loans (1): Loan release documentation with archival
• System Backups (Many) → Database State (Point-in-time): Recovery and compliance
