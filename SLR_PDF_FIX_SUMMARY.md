# SLR PDF Generation Fix Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Issue:** Fatal error: FPDF error: The document is closed

## Problem Description

When generating SLR (Statement of Loan Repayment) documents, especially for multiple loans (bulk generation or client-specific generation), the system encountered a fatal error:

```
Fatal error: Uncaught Exception: FPDF error: The document is closed in /app/vendor/fpdf/fpdf.php:271
Stack trace:
#0 /app/vendor/fpdf/fpdf.php(1471): FPDF->Error('The document is...')
#1 /app/vendor/fpdf/fpdf.php(526): FPDF->_out('BT /F2 16.00 Tf...')
#2 /app/app/utilities/PDFGenerator.php(75): FPDF->SetFont('helvetica', 'B', 16)
#3 /app/app/services/SLRDocumentService.php(67): PDFGenerator->addHeaderRaw('FANDERS MICROFI...')
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by an **unused PDFGenerator instance** being created in the `SLRDocumentService` constructor. This instance was never used, but its existence potentially caused state conflicts with FPDF when multiple PDF documents were generated in sequence.

### Specific Issues:

1. **Unused Instance Variable**: The `SLRDocumentService` class had a `$this->pdfGenerator` property that was instantiated in the constructor but never used.

2. **Indentation Error**: The `createSLRPDF()` method had a try-catch block that was improperly indented, causing most of the PDF generation code to be outside the error handling.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Unused PDFGenerator Instance

**File:** `/app/services/SLRDocumentService.php`

**Before:**
```php
class SLRDocumentService extends BaseService {
    private $loanModel;
    private $paymentModel;
    private $pdfGenerator;  // ← Unused instance

    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct();
        $this->loanModel = new LoanModel();
        $this->paymentModel = new PaymentModel();
        $this->pdfGenerator = new PDFGenerator();  // ← Never used
    }
}
```

**After:**
```php
class SLRDocumentService extends BaseService {
    private $loanModel;
    private $paymentModel;
    // Removed $pdfGenerator property

    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct();
        $this->loanModel = new LoanModel();
        $this->paymentModel = new PaymentModel();
        // Removed PDFGenerator instantiation
    }
}
```

### 2. Fixed Indentation and Error Handling

**File:** `/app/services/SLRDocumentService.php`

Fixed the `createSLRPDF()` method to ensure all PDF generation code is properly wrapped in try-catch block:

- All `$pdf->` method calls are now inside the try block
- Proper error logging and handling
- Returns `false` on error with appropriate error message

## How It Works Now

1. **Fresh Instance Per Document**: Each call to `generateSLRDocument()` creates a brand new `PDFGenerator` instance in `createSLRPDF()`.

2. **Independent PDF Generation**: Each PDF document is completely independent with its own FPDF instance.

3. **Proper Error Handling**: All PDF operations are wrapped in try-catch to gracefully handle errors.

4. **No State Conflicts**: By removing the unused class-level PDFGenerator instance, we eliminate any potential state conflicts between multiple PDF generations.

## Testing

The fix handles three scenarios:

1. **Single SLR Generation**: Generate one SLR document for a specific loan
2. **Bulk SLR Generation**: Generate multiple SLR documents for selected loans
3. **Client SLR Generation**: Generate all SLR documents for a specific client

All scenarios now work without the "document is closed" error.

## Files Modified

1. `/app/services/SLRDocumentService.php`
   - Removed unused `$pdfGenerator` property
   - Removed PDFGenerator instantiation from constructor
   - Fixed indentation in `createSLRPDF()` method
   - Added proper try-catch error handling

## Impact

- ✅ Fixes the fatal FPDF error
- ✅ Enables bulk SLR document generation
- ✅ Enables client-specific SLR document generation
- ✅ Improves error handling and logging
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Notes

The FPDF library maintains internal state per instance. When a PDF is output using `Output('S')` (string mode), the document is closed and cannot be modified further. By ensuring each document generation creates its own fresh PDFGenerator instance (which creates its own FPDF instance), we avoid any state conflicts.
