}

// Login event
{
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "session_duration": 3600
}

// Client update
{
  "old_status": "active",

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Testing
Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
php test_transaction_details_modal.php
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigate to transaction audit log page
- [ ] Click on table row - modal opens with details
- [ ] Click on card (cards view) - modal opens with details
- [ ] Verify all transaction information is displayed correctly
- [ ] Test with different transaction types (login, payment, client operations)
- [ ] Check loading state appears before details load
- [ ] Verify error handling for network issues
- [ ] Test modal close functionality (button and ESC key)
- [ ] Check responsive design on mobile devices

## 🔒 Security Features

### Authentication
- API endpoint requires user authentication
- Returns 401 Unauthorized for unauthenticated requests

### Authorization
- Only logged-in users can access transaction details
- Follows existing role-based access control patterns

### Input Validation
- Transaction ID parameter validation
- SQL injection protection through parameterized queries
- XSS protection through proper HTML escaping

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Entity Links**: Add clickable links to view related clients, loans, or payments
2. **Audit Trail**: Show related transactions for the same entity
3. **Export Options**: Allow exporting individual transaction details
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live transaction monitoring
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter details modal content based on user preferences

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed transaction details
2. **Pagination**: For transactions with extensive detail arrays
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load additional details on demand

## 📊 Impact

### User Experience
- ✅ **Faster Access**: No need to navigate away from transaction list
- ✅ **Better Understanding**: Complete context for each transaction
- ✅ **Improved Audit Trail**: Enhanced transparency and accountability

### Technical Benefits
- ✅ **Maintainable Code**: Proper separation of concerns with service layer
- ✅ **Reusable API**: Endpoint can be used by other components
- ✅ **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to extend with additional features

### Business Value
- ✅ **Compliance**: Better audit trail documentation
- ✅ **Transparency**: Clear visibility into system operations
- ✅ **Efficiency**: Reduced time spent investigating transactions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Modal doesn't open when clicking transactions:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Bootstrap is loaded correctly
- Ensure click handlers are attached after DOM is ready

**API returns 500 error:**
- Check server error logs
- Verify database connection
- Ensure TransactionService class is properly loaded

**Details show as "null" or empty:**
- Check if transaction has details field populated
- Verify JSON parsing is working correctly
- Ensure database has proper data format

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check API endpoint directly
curl -H "Cookie: session_cookie_here" "http://your-domain/public/api/get_transaction_log.php?id=1"

# Check database for transaction
SELECT * FROM transaction_logs WHERE id = 1;

# Check browser console for JavaScript errors
F12 → Console tab
```

## 📝 Development Notes

### Code Architecture
- **Service Layer**: `TransactionService` handles business logic
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoint with proper HTTP status codes
- **Presentation Layer**: Bootstrap modal with vanilla JavaScript
- **Data Layer**: `TransactionLogModel` handles database operations

### Dependencies
- **Bootstrap 5**: For modal functionality and responsive design
- **Feather Icons**: For consistent iconography
- **JSON**: For structured detail storage and parsing

This feature enhances the transaction audit system by providing users with immediate access to comprehensive transaction information, improving both user experience and system transparency.
