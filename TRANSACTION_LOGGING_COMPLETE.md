## üìù Transaction Log Schema

Each transaction log entry contains:
```
- id: Unique identifier
- user_id: Who performed the action
- entity_type: What was affected (loan, client, user, etc.)
- entity_id: Which specific record
- action: What happened (created, updated, approved, etc.)
- details: JSON with additional context
- ip_address: Where it came from
- timestamp: When it happened
```

---

## üîç Query Examples

### Check all loan approvals today:
```sql
SELECT * FROM transaction_logs 
WHERE entity_type = 'loan' 
  AND action = 'approved' 
  AND DATE(timestamp) = CURRENT_DATE;
```

### Check who modified a specific client:
```sql
SELECT tl.*, u.name as user_name
FROM transaction_logs tl
LEFT JOIN users u ON tl.user_id = u.id
WHERE tl.entity_type = 'client' 
  AND tl.entity_id = 123
ORDER BY tl.timestamp DESC;
```

### Audit all password resets:
```sql
SELECT tl.*, u.name as admin_name
FROM transaction_logs tl
LEFT JOIN users u ON tl.user_id = u.id
WHERE tl.action = 'password_reset'
ORDER BY tl.timestamp DESC;
```
